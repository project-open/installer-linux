<div id="section1" class="section"><h2><a name="section1">Description</a></h2>
<p>NaviServer is immensely scalable because it has to be. It is based on the web server
for the most heavily-used production environment in the world -- AOL.</p>
<div id="subsection1" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection1">Only load modules you need</a></h3>
<p>Modules like &quot;nsperm&quot; register extra requests that are checked on each connection,
for example. Other modules like nscgi and nscp do not need to be loaded
if you're not actually using CGI or the control port, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection2" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection2">Turn off DNS lookups wherever possible</a></h3>
<p>The nslog module has these turned off by default, but it helps to see if
it your configuration has it turned off. Also, the nsperm module uses DNS
lookups for access control -- turn this off if you don't use host access
control rules with nsperm. The nscgi module also can use DNS but, again,
it's off by default (gethostbyaddr setting). If you must use DNS, NaviServer
has a DNS cache that can be tweaked -- see &quot;dnscache&quot; and &quot;dnscachetimeout&quot;
in the config reference.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection3" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection3">Experiment with the ADP cache</a></h3>
<p>In the ns/server/servername/adp section, the parameters are &quot;cache&quot;, &quot;cachesize&quot;,
and &quot;threadcache&quot;. NaviServer defaults to a 5-megabyte cache. This cache
is used to store parsed ADP pages -- this means that ADP scripts are only
parsed once and every subsequent time they are run directly out of memory.
This means, though, that you should have a fair amount of core memory on
your system to accomodate the cache if you decide to make it very large.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection4" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection4">Experiment with the FastPath cache</a></h3>
<p>This is a separate cache used to store static HTML pages. The section is
ns/server/servername/fastpath, and the optionjs are &quot;cache&quot;, &quot;cachemaxentry&quot;,
and &quot;cachemaxsize&quot;. Like the ADP cache, this defaults to 5 megabytes.
On some systems enabling the &quot;mmap&quot; parameter can make it work even faster.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection5" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection5">Disable CheckModifiedSince</a></h3>
<p>Is your site updated rarely or often? On some slower systems, setting &quot;checkmodifiedsince&quot;
to false in the &quot;ns/server/servername&quot; section can speed up things considerably
as NaviServer reads all scripts and data directly from the in-memory cache
without checking to see if the file has changed each time a cache entry
is hit.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection6" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection6">Tune the Threads</a></h3>
<p>Thread settings are sometimes helpful, sometimes not. In ns/server/servername,
the options are &quot;connsperthread&quot;, &quot;flushcontent&quot;, &quot;maxconnections&quot;, 
&quot;maxthreads&quot;, &quot;minthreads&quot; and &quot;threadtimeout&quot;. In nearly all cases the
defaults are optimal, with the exception of maxthreads which should be carefully
adjusted based on your load. Along with &quot;maxthreads&quot;, the &quot;maxconnections&quot;
setting can be tricky, since making it too large can cause your system to
thrash.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection7" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection7">Monitor the Memory</a></h3>
<p>Memory considerations are paramount on heavily-used servers. Use the &quot;ps
-leaf&quot; on most systems to look at the &quot;nsd&quot; processes. Nearly all the memory
used by nsd should be in RSS (resident set size). If the nsd process' RSS
is less than 2/3 its SZ, then it's a good chance that your operating system
is thrashing, meaning it's spending more time managing memory than allowing
the system to work to its capacity. Some operating systems actually limit
the total RSS used by any one process. That 1-gigabyte machine might only 
allow NaviServer to use 500 megabytes of core at any one time -- this is 
especially the case with SGI servers.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection8" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection8">Beware the Database</a></h3>
<p>Databases are a bottleneck. Do you use lots of simple queries that return
a hoard of data? Investigate using stored procedures or finely-tuned queries
so that you get only the data you actually want and make the database do
the work it was designed to do. Don't make your system spend its time putting
together those ns_getrow structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="subsection9" class="subsection"><h3><a name="subsection9">Collect metrics and use them</a></h3>
<p>NaviServer has a built-in statistics-gathering system that collects data on
the caches, tcl interps, threads, and other interesting data. We use these
at AOL to gather an immense amount of data on how the systems are working
and where they need to be improved (more cache, less cache, more memory,
more threads, etc).  The module &quot;nsstats&quot; can be dropped into any
running server to get a snapshot of how it's doing. The module is available
in the modules repository.</p>
